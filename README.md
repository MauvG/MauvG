Hi my name is Muavia.

I am currently a second year student in Trinity College (TCD) pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and ideally, a master's degree after that. I find software engineering and web development to be incredibly interesting.

I have a strong interest in computer science and I'm eager to learn more. I want to take on fresh tasks and work through difficult issues. I enjoy working in teams and I'm constantly seeking for intriguing chances to put my abilities to the test.
