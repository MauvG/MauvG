Hi, my name is Muavia Ghazi.

I am a third year student in Trinity College (TCD) pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and ideally, a master's degree after that.

I'm passionate about web development, software engineering and game development. I'm eager to expand my knowledge. I enjoy working in teams and I'm constantly seeking for intriguing chances to put my abilities to the test.
